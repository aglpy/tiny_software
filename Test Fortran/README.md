# Test-Fortran

Test-Fortran is a user-interactive console program written in Fortran that assesses a user's knowledge about the Fortran programming language. During the program execution, a series of questions related to Fortran will be asked and based on the user's responses, a final score will be calculated and displayed.

## Requirements

- GNU Fortran compiler, `gfortran`.

## Compiling

To compile the program, use the `gfortran` compiler as follows:

```bash
gfortran test_fortran.f -o test_fortran.exe
```

This will create an executable `test_fortran.exe` in the same directory.

## Running

After compiled, the program can be run as follows:

```bash
./test_fortran.exe
```
